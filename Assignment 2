#Problem 1.1 - Data Exploration
#We begin by exploring the data. Plot all of the states' centers with latitude on the y axis (the "y" variable in our dataset) and longitude on the x axis (the "x" variable in our dataset). The shape of the plot should look like the outline of the United States! Note that Alaska and Hawaii have had their coordinates adjusted to appear just off of the west coast.
plot(statedata$x, statedata$y)

#Problem 1.2 - Data Exploration
#Using the tapply command, determine which region of the US (West, North Central, South, or Northeast) has the highest average high school graduation rate of all the states in the region:
tapply(statedata$HS.Grad,statedata$state.region, mean)

#Problem 1.3 - Data Exploration
#Now, make a boxplot of the murder rate by region (for more information about creating boxplots in R, type ?boxplot in your console).
#Which region has the highest median murder rate?
boxplot(statedata$Murder ~ statedata$state.region)

#Problem 1.4 - Data Exploration
NortheastData = subset(statedata, state.region == "Northeast")
NortheastData

#Problem 2.1 - Predicting Life Expectancy - An Initial Model
#We would like to build a model to predict life expectancy by state using the state statistics we have in our dataset.
#Build the model with all potential variables included (Population, Income, Illiteracy, Murder, HS.Grad, Frost, and Area). Note that you should use the variable "Area" in your model, NOT the variable "state.area".
#What is the coefficient for "Income" in your linear regression model?
linearReg = lm(Life.Exp ~ Population + Income + Illiteracy + Murder + HS.Grad + Frost + Area, data=statedata)
summary(linearReg)

#Problem 2.3 - Predicting Life Expectancy - An Initial Model
#Now plot a graph of life expectancy vs. income using the command:
  
plot(statedata$Income, statedata$Life.Exp)

#Visually observe the plot. What appears to be the relationship?


linearReg2 = lm(Life.Exp ~ Population  + Murder + HS.Grad + Frost , data=statedata)
summary(linearReg2)

which.max(statedata$Life.Exp)
